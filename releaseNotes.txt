*** NOTE ***

This project was originally available only as an archive on
Sourceforge. I decided to import the project into github (for easier
contributions), introduce some commonly used Java tools (junit, maven)
and make a few stylistic changes in an effort to revive the project.

Most of the development, however, was done by the original
team. Unfortunately there is no VCS history available for this (it was
released as a zip file), so original author information is not
available in the git repository.
